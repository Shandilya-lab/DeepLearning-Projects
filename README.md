File ./DL_MiniProject_1.py contains our PyTorch description of our ResNet model architecture.
File ./checkpoint/ckpt.pt contains the trained weights of this architecture.

If required to run the model from starting:
execute: $ python DL_MiniProject.py

If required to resume the model from the saved checkpoint:
execute: $ python DL_MiniProject.py --resume
