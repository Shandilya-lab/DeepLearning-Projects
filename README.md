# DeepLearning-Projects
## TO DO:
1. Any data augmentation strategies you like (this is highly encouraged!).
    - Add Grayscale if makes a difference.
2. Any optimizer, including but not limited to SGD, ADAM, etc.
    - Measure the difference between SGD and ADAM.
    - Accuracy is far better for Adam. __How much?
3. Any regularization scheme.  
    - Try using L2 and Dropout.
4. Any choice of batch size and epochs of training, or even new/fancy training procedures.
    - As minimum as needed. Avoid overfitting. Plot the graphs.
